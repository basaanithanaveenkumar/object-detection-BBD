## All Classes Distribution

| Class                   | Count    |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Car                     | 714,121  |
| Lane/Single White       | 247,108  |
| Traffic Sign            | 239,961  |
| Traffic Light           | 186,301  |
| Lane/Road Curb          | 109,868  |
| Lane/Crosswalk          | 108,284  |
| Person                  | 91,435   |
| Area/Drivable           | 64,050   |

| Lane/Single Other       | 249      |
| Train                   | 136

## Occlusion Analysis

An analysis was performed on all classes with respect to the **`occluded`** attribute. Results show that nearly half of the objects are occluded.

### Occlusion Statistics

| Occlusion Status | Count    |
|------------------|----------|
| False            | 678,981  |
| True             | 609,424  |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Observation:** A significant portion of the dataset contains occluded objects, which may impact detection accuracy and should be considered during model training and evaluation.



# Additional training Dataset Analysis

## Bounding Box Size Distribution

| Size Category       | Percentage | Interpretation                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Small** (<2% area) | 92.2%      | Dominates dataset - consider higher resolution or small object detection techniques |
| **Medium** (2-10%)  | 6.3%       | Underrepresented - may need augmentation                                      |
| **Large** (>10%)    | 1.5%       | Very rare - ensure model can handle context                                   |

**Recommendations:**
- Implement multi-scale training
- Use Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)

## Bounding Box Aspect Ratios

| Aspect Ratio        | Percentage | Interpretation                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tall** (<0.5)     | 12.3%      | Vertical objects present - adjust anchor boxes                                |
| **Square** (0.5-2)  | 76.9%      | Majority class - standard anchors should work well                            |
| **Wide** (‚â•2)       | 10.8%      | Horizontal objects - may need custom anchors                                 |
